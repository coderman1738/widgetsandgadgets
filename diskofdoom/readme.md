Disk of doom is a directory you can use to create a CD or DVD that contains an autorunning virus. Upon plugging the disk in, the computer will run payload.txt you can reference the program of your choice in payload.txt. Enjoy!

Suggestion:
I highly suggest you include a tracker, or an html file that payload.bat runs. This webpage redirects to a goo.gl link. This way, you can see who opens your dvd.

To set up the diskofdoom, select the flavor you want by choosing one of the payload directories, copy all the content of the directory to the disk, but do not copy the folder, all the content should be in the root directory of the disk.
