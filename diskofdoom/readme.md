Disk of doom is a directory you can use to create a CD or DVD that contains an autorunning virus. Upon plugging the disk in, the computer will run payload.txt you can reference the program of your choice in payload.txt. Enjoy!

Suggestion:
I highly suggest you include a tracker, or an html file that payload.bat runs. This webpage redirects to a goo.gl link. This way, you can see who opens your dvd.
